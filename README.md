# 23/08/24 - flask_todo_cli (#16)
This is a basic todo list CRUD app using the click python package as the cli. The list is stored in a json file and rendered using flask which uses the jinja template.

I think I will do some more backend miniprojects before returning to frontend. I don't have much experience with backend so my goal is to implement a couple more basic backend architectures probably in flask although I may play around with expressjs as well when I get more comfortable with the concepts. I want to focus on HTTP and SQL because I have very elementary knowledge of those. Particularly HTTP because I want to dabble into the cybersecurity world some time in the future.
